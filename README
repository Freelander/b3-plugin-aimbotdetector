Description
-----------

This plugin detects unusual killstreaks for a given body part. (Generally this is supposed to be headshot kills)
For instance it can be adjusted to detect headshots made in a row and if headshot kill streak reaches to a set 
value, either the player is kicked or all online admins are notified.
