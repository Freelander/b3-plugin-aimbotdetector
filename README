Description
-----------

This plugin detects unusual killstreaks and when a suspicious user is detected he is either
kicked, tempbanned, banned or online admins notified depending on your selection. it can also send 
you an alert e-mail.

How to Use the Plugin
---------------------

You can use this plugin in different ways.

For example you can check for consecutive kills for a given hit location. Let's say you configured the 
plugin to check headshots only and set the treshold to 5. In this case, the plugin will trigger if any 
player makes 5 headshots in a row without dying. If you add more than one hit location, remember that 
plugin will count the total of all hitlocations you entered.

There's also a time limit option as of version 1.4. If you use that option, the plugin will count the 
consecutive kills achived within the time limit. For example 10 kills in 8 seconds. If you're using time 
limit, it's always better to add all hitlocations in the config file.

It's also a good idea to exclude weapons gained by killstreaks if available in the game. For example you 
can get many kills using carpet bomb in cod blackops and that will lead to a false alarm if you haven't 
excluded the weapon.

All settings in the config file have explanation above them. Remember that if you're not sure of your 
settings, always use notify only option to avoid false kicks and bans.
